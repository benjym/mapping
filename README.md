# mapping toolbox

This is a set of interactive tools which are designed to be used for educational purposes. They are not validated and rely on data that is not of a quality that can be used for design purposes.

The mapping toolbox currently contains:
  - pollution module, for modelling the spread of pollutants in the air using a gaussian plume model
  - slope stability module, for assessing slope stability using a few simple models
  - rockfall module, for assistance in designing protection structures to divert rockfalls

## Pollution module
Visualise the dispersion of a plume on top of a map. [Try it out here](https://benjym.github.io/mapping/pollution.html).

## Slope stability module
[Try it out here](https://benjym.github.io/mapping/slope-stability.html).

## Rockfall module
Choose a location for your rockfall and the system will begin spawning particles at that location. The properties of the particles are adjustable. You can right click on the map to add rigid protection structures. [Try it out here](https://benjym.github.io/mapping/rockfall.html).
